# Markoth Shield

This mod replaces Dreamshield with Markoth Shield, which has all the same properties but produces an additional shield on the opposite side of the player. 
The difficulty level for unlocking the Markoth Shield can be configured from the menu.

Additionally, this mod integrates with Exaltation Expanded: unlocking both the Markoth Shield and the Mothshield transforms Dreamshield into the 
Radiant Shield, which surrounds the player with 4 shields.
